# Flask-Shopping-Website
On this project, I created a full-functioning shopping website for the brand Giuly's Studio, an Indie shopping store. I started with the brand's logo and identity for a homogenous design on the website. I then dove into the coding and used Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring my ideas to life. 

This Flask web application serves as a basic template for building a web application using the Flask framework. It includes user authentication, database integration using SQLAlchemy, and a simple structure to get you started with web development.


### üìÑ __Init.py__ Features:
- **Flask Framework:** 
  The application is built using the Flask micro-framework, providing a lightweight and modular structure for web development.

- **SQLAlchemy Integration:** 
  Utilizes the SQLAlchemy library for easy and efficient database operations.
  The default database is SQLite, and you can modify the DB_NAME variable in the script to change the database file name.

- **User Authentication:** 
  Implements user authentication with the help of the Flask-Login extension.
  The application provides login and registration functionality.

- **Blueprint Structure:** 
  Organizes the application into two blueprints: views for general views and auth for authentication-related views.

- **Database Creation:** 
  Includes a function (create_database) to create the database if it does not exist.

### üìÑ auth.py Features:
With this section, users can sign up, log in, add products to their shopping cart, and complete a purchase.

1. üîë_**User Authentication**_
- Users can sign up with a valid email, first name, and password.
- Passwords are securely hashed using the SHA-256 algorithm.
- Existing users can log in with their credentials.
- Sessions are used to keep track of the authenticated user.
  
2. ‚å®Ô∏è_**Product Management**_
- Products can be added to the database with information such as product name, price, image path, and carbon footprint.
- The product list is displayed in the shopping area, allowing users to browse available items.

3. üõí_**Shopping Cart**_
- Users can add products to their shopping cart.
- The shopping cart is implemented using Flask sessions.
- Users can view their cart, remove items, and proceed to checkout.

4. üíµ_**Checkout and Payment**_
- Users can proceed to the payment page to view their selected items and the total price.
- A payment success page is displayed after completing a purchase.
