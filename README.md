# Flask-Shopping-Website
On this project, I created a full-functioning shopping website for the brand Giuly's Studio, an Indie shopping store. I started with the brand's logo and identity for a homogenous design on the website. I then dove into the coding and used Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring my ideas to life. 

This Flask web application serves as a basic template for building a web application using the Flask framework. It includes user authentication, database integration using SQLAlchemy, and a simple structure to get you started with web development.


Features
- Flask Framework
  The application is built using the Flask micro-framework, providing a lightweight and modular structure for web development.

- SQLAlchemy Integration
  Utilizes the SQLAlchemy library for easy and efficient database operations.
  The default database is SQLite, and you can modify the DB_NAME variable in the script to change the database file name.

- User Authentication
  Implements user authentication with the help of the Flask-Login extension.
  The application provides login and registration functionality.

- Blueprint Structure
  Organizes the application into two blueprints: views for general views and auth for authentication-related views.

- Database Creation
  Includes a function (create_database) to create the database if it does not exist.
